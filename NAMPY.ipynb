        "Answer:\n",
        "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing. It provides efficient array objects and functions for mathematical operations. It's widely used due to its speed, support for large datasets, and compatibility with other scientific libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding their dimensions to match. This simplifies array arithmetic without explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "A DataFrame is a 2D labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a table in a database or an Excel spreadsheet. It allows data manipulation with columns of different types.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The groupby() method is used to group data based on one or more keys and apply aggregation functions (like sum, mean). It's useful for summarizing large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
